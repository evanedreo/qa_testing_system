    Steps:
    1. Open the website.
        - Enter the website URL in a web browser to access the homepage.
    2. Locate the 'Create New User' button and click it.
        - Navigate to the section of the website where user management is handled.
        - Identify and click the "Create New User" button to open the user creation form.
    3. Generate random user details and input them into the form.
        - Use a random data generator or manually create fictional user details (e.g., name, email, username, password).
        - Fill in the form fields with the generated data.
    4. Click submit and verify user creation.
        - Click the "Submit" button to create the new user.
        - Verify that the user is successfully created by:
            -Checking for a confirmation message or notification.
            -Searching for the new user in the user list or database.
            -Ensuring the user details match the input data.

    Expected Outcome:
    - The system successfully creates a new user.
    - The new user entry appears in the **customer list** with the correct details.
    - If validation fails, the user should see an **appropriate error message**.
    - The form should not allow incorrect inputs (e.g., empty fields, invalid email format).
    - The system should handle errors gracefully without crashing or unresponsive behavior.

    - Are **error messages missing, unclear, or misleading**, leading to difficulties in debugging or troubleshooting?
    - Is the **layout or UI rendering incorrect** (e.g., broken styling, overlapping elements, misaligned buttons)?

    - Are there any **unexpected behaviors, performance issues, or crashes** that disrupt the user experience?

    - **Critical Bug:** The functionality does not work at all.

    - **No Bug:** The behavior is correct.
